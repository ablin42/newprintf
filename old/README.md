# ft_printf
#### This is my own implementation of printf done @ 42 Paris.

Recoding printf allows us to use it for our future projects and makes us discover new C Features: *Variadic functions* and printing options with flags !

I have uploaded the directory printf_tests which holds alot of tests for ft_printf, beware the return value can get buggy for the original printf

### Note: this version of printf doesn't handle floats/doubles nor the flags *, $, L, '.
### It handles:
> -  Conversion specifiers: sSpdDioOuUxXcC
> - flags (#, 0, -, +, ' ')
> - field width 
> - precision
> - length modifiers (hh, h, l, ll, j, z)

### Objectives
